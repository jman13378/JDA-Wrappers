## Usage

### Listener

1. Create a listener class 
2. Make the class extend [ListenerAdapter](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA5/javadoc/net/dv8tion/jda/api/hooks/ListenerAdapter.html) `public class foobar extends ListenerAdapter {...}`
3. Add 2 methods and a [HashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)â„¢
    - [`@SuppressWarnings({ "unchecked", "rawtypes" })
    private static final HashMap<String, SlashCommand> commands = new HashMap();`](https://github.com/jman13378/JDA-Wrappers/blob/main/SlashCommand/examples/listener.java#L36)
    - [`public foobar() {...}`](https://github.com/jman13378/JDA-Wrappers/blob/main/SlashCommand/examples/listener.java#L38)
    - @Override [`public void onSlashCommandInteraction(SlashCommandInteractionEvent event) {...}`](https://github.com/jman13378/JDA-Wrappers/blob/main/SlashCommand/examples/listener.java#L46)
4. Add your slash commands within your listener [example](https://github.com/jman13378/JDA-Wrappers/blob/main/SlashCommand/examples/listener.java#L40)

### Slash Commands

1. Create a Java class
2. Make the class extend [SlashCommand](https://github.com/jman13378/JDA-Wrappers/blob/main/SlashCommand/SlashCommand.java) `public class foobar extends SlashCommand {...}`
3. Add the methods 
    - `public void execute(SlashCommandEvent event) {...}`
